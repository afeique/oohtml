## description
This is a small set of classes and helper methods for quickly generating and manipulating HTML within PHP using PHP objects and method chaining.

## dependencies
Requires my [error class](https://github.com/afeique/error). Place the `error` directory in the same directory as the `validator` directory, or just modify the `require_once()` statements to your liking.

## comments
* Usage information will be added at a later date.
* Classes are not enclosed in a namespace which may lead to conflicts; user discretion is advised.
* This github repository was created with the express purpose of helping me with versioning control across multiple projects that use the same code.
